Introduction to Python
======================

This repo contains some materials I use for a 3 hour session I conduct for the Rangeview High School Cyber Boot Camp. My presentation is an introduction to programming, and to the python language. What I want the students to get out of the presentation is a basic understanding of what programming is, what can be done with it, and some basic programming concepts.

# Contents
### intro_presentation
This is an [ImpressJS](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/) presentation that is used at the beginning of the session to introduce myself and my assistants, and to introduce programming as a whole.

### python_presentation
This is a [Big](https://github.com/tmcw/big) presentation meant to introduce basic programming concepts using python. It's also a big presentation, 768 slides.

### Examples
Contains two examples of some basic programs
* CoinToss.py - Simulate tossing a coin
* Log.py - Write input to a "log file"
* AdvanceLog.py - A cleaner version of Log

### concepts.py
This is essentially notes for going through the basic ideas of programming. The Big (python_presentation) presentation loosely follows the order of this.
